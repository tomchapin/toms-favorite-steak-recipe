# Tom Chapin's Favorite Steak Method (2025)
### Cube-Finish Double-Sear — maximum crust, zero chewy bits, minimal fuss

> **Goal:** every single bite is crusty, juicy, and free of chewy sinew.  
> Works whether your steak starts frozen, fridge-cold, or room-temp—just adjust sear/cool time by feel.

## Core Steps

| Step | What you do | Why it matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **1. Big-Chunk Sear** | Drop an unseasoned steak (any starting temp) onto a screaming-hot carbon-steel or cast-iron pan. Brown every surface hard and fast. | Builds maximum Maillard crust without over-cooking the interior. |
| **2. Cool Down** | Move steak to a board. Let it sit only until it’s cool enough to cut cleanly. <br>• If the steak began frozen → longer cool so the center fully thaws. <br>• Fridge-cold or room-temp → short pause, just to stop surface sizzling. | Interior relaxes; safe to handle and trim. |
| **3. Cube & Trim** | Cut into bite-size cubes (≈¾–1 in). Trim any silver skin, sinew, big hard-fat seams. | Guarantees zero unpleasant chew. |
| **4. Season** | Salt the cubes (pepper later if you like). | Seasoning happens once there’s no moisture pull problem. |
| **5. Cube Sear** | Same pan, still blazing. Work hibachi-style: brief sit → scrape/flip/tumble → repeat until **all faces** brown. Pull juicy cubes first, let fattier/smaller cubes crisp a touch longer if you like variety. | Second Maillard pass plus final doneness—everything edible, nothing bland. |
| **6. Eat** | Plate immediately or let cubes rest a minute if you want carry-over. | Flavor is highest right out of the pan; rest only if you prefer it. |

## Why This Beats Single-Sear Steaks

- **Edge-to-edge flavor:** every cube owns a crust, not just the steak’s rim.  
- **No chew traps:** sinew is removed before final sear, not discovered mid-chew.  
- **Flexible start:** frozen, fridge, or room-temp all work—only the cool-down length changes.  
- **No mystic “10-min rest” doctrine:** cool only as needed; final bites hit the plate hot.

## Gear (Apartment-Friendly)

| Gear                | Detail                                   |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Carbon-steel pan\*  | Lightweight, hits extreme heat fast      |
| Strong stovetop burner | Needed for true sear heat            |
| Metal spatula       | Flip / tumble cubes                      |

\*Any truly hot, heavy pan works—just not non-stick at sear temps.

## Notes & Tweaks

* **Serving variety?** Keep every cube moving; pull thicker lean cubes the instant they bounce back; leave smaller fatty ones one extra flip for “beef-bacon” bites.  
* **Pepper burns above ~350 °C.** Add it after cooking or keep your final sear gentle if you want pepper bark.  
* **Frozen starts:** expect a longer first sear for crust plus a longer cool so the interior is sliceable. Everything else is identical.
